Hey there! 👋 I'm Grzegorz. I'm not your typical programmer - I'm deeply passionate about philosophy and history, which shapes how I approach problem-solving.

I love building practical systems and apps that solve real-world problems. I'm aspiring to become a Backend Developer and currently diving deep into the .NET ecosystem."
